Assignment 0: Miles to Km to Miles Assignment
Topics: Create a makefile
Author: Jeffrey Schachtsick

** Files **
assign0.c
makefile

** Compiling **
Each of the files included in this file have been compiled using Visual Studio 2013.  You could also compile the files using gcc.  It should be noted, the files should not be compiled together, but as seperate programs.  To compile them all at once, I was provided with a makefile from the course which is included.

** Assignment 0 Program **
This program will essentially convert miles into kilometers or will convert kilometers into miles.  The user will enter into a loop until the user would like to quit.  However, while in the loop, the user can select to do one of the 2 conversions and the user can enter a value for it to be converted.
