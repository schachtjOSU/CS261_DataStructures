Topics: Linked List and Circle Linked list
Author: Jeffrey Schachtsick

** Files **
- Linked List Deque
	linkedList.c
	linkedList.h
	linkedListMain.c
	makefile
- Circle Linked List
	cirListDeque.c
	cirListDeque.h
	listDequeTest.c
	makefile

** Compiling **
Each of the files included in the CirListDeque and LLDequeBag folders have been compiled using Visual Studio 2013.  You could also compile the files using gcc.  It should be noted, the files should not be compiled together, but as seperate programs.  To compile them all at once, I have a created a makefile for each.

Completion of the implementation of the Linked List.

** Deque ADT Program **
Completion of the implementation of the Deque ADT.
